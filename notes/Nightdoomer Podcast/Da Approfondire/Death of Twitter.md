Engineers and "anyone who should be writing code in other departments" were informed of a new process for keeping track of their work, according to a Monday evening email sent from the address being used by Musk and his leadership team. Starting this week, everyone coding or doing technical work will be expected to submit a weekly summary of what they worked on, what they hoped to complete, and specific lines of code they wrote.

Twitter Team,

In order to innovate rapidly on software, it is critical to understand what everyone is working on and who is coding what.

Moving forward, every Friday (this week, on Wednesday), please email the following weekly update to xxxxxxxxx@twitter.com with the following format:

-Subject line: "Weekly Update, name, dept, and date (eg "Weekly Update, John smith, SWE, 11/20)

-Email Body:

-   -   What project you are working on (eg Blue Verified)
    -   What you are trying to accomplish (eg reliably collect the $8 payment)
    -   Code Samples/Phabricator links of code written that week

This weekly update applies to:

-   -   All managers/engineers in SWE and ML
    -   Anyone who should be writing code in other departments, such as SRE and Network
    -   For technical positions where code is not written (eg network/database admin), replace "Code samples/Phabricator links" above with "Summary of work"
    -   For technical positions where code is not written and analyses are being performer (eg data scientist), replace "Code sample/Phabricator links" with "Summary and results of analysis"

If there are any questions or ambiguity, please email xxxxxxxxx@twitter.com

Looking forward to making Twitter the highest performing tech software company in the world.

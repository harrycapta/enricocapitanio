If you have a limited data plan, it’s worth knowing how much data Amazon #Alexa uses. According to Amazon Echo data usage statistics, Alexa uses 36MB per day, which translates to 252MB per week or 1.08GB per month. The numbers are based on 30 minutes of music streaming, two smart-home commands, one question about the weather, and one general question.

A report released last week contends that #Amazon uses voice data from its #Alexa Echo devices to serve targeted ads on its own platforms and the web. The report, produced by researchers affiliated with the University of Washington, UC Davis, UC Irvine, and Northeastern University, said the ways Amazon does this is inconsistent with its privacy policies. https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/28/23047026/amazon-alexa-voice-data-targeted-ads-research-report

The company also confirmed there are targeted ads on its smart speakers. “Customers may receive interest-based ads when they use ad-supported premium content – like music, radio or news streams,” said https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-raemhild-a972516b/, pointing out that this is the same experience if they engaged with that content on other channels. She went on to say that Amazon does not share voice recordings with developers. “Developers get the information necessary to fulfill your requests within their skills, such as answers when you play a trivia skill, or the name of the song you want to play,” she said. “We do not share our customers’ personal information to third-party skills without the customer’s consent.”

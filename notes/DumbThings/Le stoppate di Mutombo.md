GOOD DAY, I am aware that this is certainly not a conventional way of approaching an unknown person for the establishment of a project and investment. But I respectfully insist you read this message carefully before you either make your decision of proceeding or deleting my message, as I am optimistic it will be successful for unimaginable financial benefit for both of us. I am Mrs. Zenani Mandela, former ambassador of South Africa to Argentina from 2012 until 2017 when I was appointed as the South African high commissioner to Mauritius. The First Daughter of South African icon and freedom fighter late  Winnie Madikizela  Mandela, The Wife of  The former  President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999 who died on December 5, 2013, after a protracted lung infection, contracted during his 27th years of incarceration in Robin Island prison.

I managed to get your contact details online here in Johannesburg South Africa in my desperate search for a trustworthy person to assist me in this confidential business transaction. My Late  Mother  Winnie madikizela  Mandela just died  On 2nd  April  2018, and she left behind some funds in a trust fund account  Amounting to US$ 15 million Dollars. I am cancer long-suffering, the doctor has advised me that I may not live for more than three months, and warned me to stop thinking over who is going to inherit my money.  I want this fund transferred out of South Africa for investments/contributions to the less privileged, and orphanage homes, and some of it be used for charity works. Therefore indicate your full interest in the assurance of trust, so that we can actualize this great opportunity together and share the benefit together with the help of God. And in the area you are not interested in this deal please kindly ignore it immediately. If interested; kindly respond via my email, your full name, and private phone numbers, or call me.

With Regards, in sincerity,

#dumbthings

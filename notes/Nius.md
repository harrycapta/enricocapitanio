Mounting losses and massive job cuts are leading to the downfall of Amazon's #Alexa  voice assistant. Amazon's Worldwide Digital unit, which includes Echo smart speakers and Alexa voice technology, had an operating loss of over $3 billion during the first quarter of this year. A vast majority of the losses were tied to Alexa and other devices. The Alexa division is now the prime target for layoffs at the company. Amazon's Senior Vice President for Devices and Services claimed in a statement that the company remains committed to Alexa and will continue to invest in the technology. #Amazon 

"Alexa is a colossal failure of imagination," one former employee said. "It was a wasted opportunity."

1) Random hard drive fills up. You have no idea how common it is for a single hosed box to cause cascading failures across systems, even well-engineered fault-tolerant ones with active maintenance. Where's the box? What's filling it up? Who will figure that out? #twitter

The fallout from [Elon Musk's request](https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/twitter-locks-its-office-doors-and-suspends-badge-access-on/439438) that Twitter staff commit "hardcore" to make Twitter 2.0 or get out revealed that given a choice, some people would rather get out. Following the [Tesla](https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/tesla-reports-two-fatalities-in-new-us-accident-report/439429) mogul's declaration earlier this week that staff make it clear they were all in or leave (with severance), as many as 1,200 of the remaining 3,700 workers chose to resign.

Raddoppiano le vittime minorenni colpite dal reato di #sextortion, il ricatto a sfondo sessuale per estorcere denaro in cui le vittime vengono minacciate di pubblicare foto o video compromettenti se non rispondono alla richiesta: la variazione percentuale sul totale dei casi trattati nel 2021 (101) è stata del +94% rispetto all'anno precedente. E' quanto emerge da un report della Direzione centrale della polizia criminale. https://www.ncsc.admin.ch/ncsc/en/home/cyberbedrohungen/sextortion.html

Secondo il documento, "la #sextortion impatta su vittime minorenni, con effetti lesivi potenziati: la vergogna che i ragazzi provano impedisce loro di chiedere aiuto ai genitori o ai coetanei". Nel 2021 su 101 casi, 77 hanno riguardato la fascia 14-17 anni e 23 quella 10-13.

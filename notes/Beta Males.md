# Beta Males

Beta males are the ‘lieutenants’ of the socio sexual hierarchy. They’re fiercely loyal to their alphas. In exchange for this loyalty, they enjoy many of the benefits of high status and position. Beta males are crucial to a stable hierarchy, and enforce the alpha’s rules to maintain order and structure.
